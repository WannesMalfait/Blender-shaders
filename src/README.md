# About this Book

The goal of this book is to be a resource for people learning about procedural shaders in blender. It is still a **work in progress**. I don't know
everything, and will therefore not be able to cover everything. The shaders from this book are also not optimized, and serve only as a learning resource.
A lot of info can already be found on the [official blender documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/).
If something in the book is not clear, you can try searching for help in the documentation. 

The book focuses on creating procedural shaders in blender, i.e. it is **not** a tutorial for blender itself. The early chapters are aimed at complete beginners, and serve as a replacement for my series on youtube: [Math in the node editor](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHwudW8KFVowaZMvH7DGsxSaHE_qPvX_k).
Here we will look at how we can manipulate coordinates to create all sorts of cool effects. Later chapters will be more advanced and cover more interesting topics such as vector displacement. There will also be a small chapter on python scripting.
