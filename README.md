# Blender Shaders

This is the source used to generate the [book](https://wannesmalfait.github.io/Blender-shaders/). To view the generated code checkout to the branch `gh-pages`.


## Setup

The html, css and js files for the book are generated using [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), from the src directory here. The files produced by mdbook are added to a directory called book. In this directory a new git repo is active which is tied to the gh-pages branch.
